In this version there are some new features:

- Teachers can vote
- Stats are available to be downloaded in a CSV file
- Teachers can edit their students data

And we have fixed an important bug:

- When a student edits an old post, in the previous version of FAVS, there were a little probability that the planet includes that post time and tiem again. That problem is fixed in this new version.
